### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned an introduction to AJAX. AJAX allows client web pages to quickly interact and
exchange data with a web server. It relies on programming language such as JavaScript and data interchange format such as JSON or XML
2. We learned about web service: Web service is data source made available on one domain for use on
other domains across web. It does not contain graphical user interface or commandline
interface. It simply provides services and data in response to
requests
3. We learned the difference bettwen HTTP clients and messages. HTTP messages
HTTP client requests and server responses. HTTP client opens a connection to the server; it submits a request message
